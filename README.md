# Eyes on Target
Eyes on Target (single-player and 2-player game)

This game has been written purely in C++ with various libraries used for application designing, file management, data encryption etc.

It is a simple number-based game for upto 2 players. Single players can play against the computer, or 2 players can play against each other.
The game is intended for brain-storming purposes, where players need to calculate and predict their opponents' moves to figure out their way to victory.

I hope people trying out this game go through a nerve-wracking time figuring out their winning strategies !

Demo gameplay video links shall be uploaded here soon...
